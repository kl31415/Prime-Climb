# Prime-Climb
Training an agent to optimally play a variation of the game Prime Climb for CS 238.

# Usage
To use current model: 
Run rollagain_anyorder_train.py, rollagain_anyorder_simulate.py, and then rollagain_anyorder_evaluate.py.
Run rollagain_train.py, rollagain_simulate.py, and then rollagain_evaluate.py.

The "anyorder" files are for when the dice can be rolled in any order. Prior to creating these files, we configured our algorithm such that the first roll had to be used first and the second one second.
